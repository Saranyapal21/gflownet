# Private sister repository of gflownet

This repository (`gflownet-dev`) is private. It is meant to be used to develop research ideas and projects before making them public in the original [alexhernandezgarcia/gflownet](https://github.com/alexhernandezgarcia/gflownet) repository (`gflownet`).

As of October 2023, it is uncertain whether we will stick to this plan in the long term, but the idea is the following:

- Develop ideas and projects in `gflownet-dev`.
- Upon publication or whenever the authors feel comfortable, transfer the relevant code to `gflownet`. 
- Relevant code improvements and development that does not compromise research projects should be transferred to `gflownet` as early as possible.

This involves extra complexity, so we will re-evaluate or refine this plan after a test period.
